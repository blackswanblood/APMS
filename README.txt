CPSC304 Project

Hello all!

Project description

Our group decided to concentrate on the domain of theme parks (amusement parks). The database of our project models the employment, logistics, and ticket services of the park. 

Staff

There will be staff with different roles: cashiers, technicians, and operators, each tending to their respective facilities. 

Ticket

Regarding tickets, tourists can choose from day passes or individual rides: ride tickets will be associated with individual rides, and day passes will provide access for all rides. Tickets are merely for rides. There are also tickets for children and adults based on the touristâ€™s age. 

Tourist

Tourists can play on arcade machines, where they can win points to exchange gifts. Each arcade offers different gifts as prizes. All the arcades in the park have some arcade machines, but it is possible that identical machines appear in different arcades. Consequently, machines cannot uniquely be identified by its name unless combined with the arcade it belongs to.

Inspired by a dating app and Disney land database management system.
